# Let's Test it Out - C++ Template

A.J.'s FizzBuzz catch2 Assignment
===============================

how to use
----------
This project is not intended for the user to modify or interact with. As such there is no interactive element provided. However I beleve it relevent to explain what the "fizzbuzz" method does.

The "fizzbuzz" method impemented in "fizzbuzz.hpp" takes and interger perameter "i". If "i" is devisable by 3 and 5 then the method returns the string "FizzBuzz". If "i" is devisable by 3 and not 5 then the method returns the string "Fizz". If "i" is devisable by 5 and not 3 then the method returns the string "Buzz". If "i" is not devisable by 3 or 5 then the method returns "i".

how to compile and run
----------------------
To compile the tests open a console in the source folder and use the command:
```
g++ -Wall fizzbuzz_tests.cpp -o fizzbuzz_test.out
```

After compilation to run the tests use the command:
```
./fizzbuzz_tests.out
```
